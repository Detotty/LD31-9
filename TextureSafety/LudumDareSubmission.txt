Santa's Seasonal Slayfest

By Gareth Williams (@garethiw), Carl Hughes (@devilqube) and Paul Yendley (@gredgie)

Instead of coal this year, Santa has in fact thrown two bad children into his gladiatorial arena, where they must appease a crowd of elves, twisted from their mindless work in Santa's joyous workshops.

Fight your way through as many waves of enemies as you can either on your own or with a keyboard buddy, let the bodies pile up as your spectators throw all manner of weaponry and items to keep the entertainment going!
